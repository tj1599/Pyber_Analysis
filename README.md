## Summary
Urban has to many drivers for the total rides that are provided.
Rural has more rides than drivers but less total rides than Suburban and Urban because of the overall fare cost
If Rural could shift their total fare cost closer to Suburban and give incentives to the driver to be increase I believe that they're going to be more total traffic and sales
